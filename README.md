# Covid19_2020_to_2021_sql_project

The dataset for this SQL project is derived from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

The deaths table for February 2020 to June 2021 has been retrieved for this project which is done in MySQL Workbench. 
For a simpler analysis, I have dissected the data from the deaths table by excluding and removing some columns. 
The data is cleaned, validated, and transformed for accuracy and data integrity purpose. 

### The queries carried out can be used to answer questions and provide helpful findings/insights such as:
- What is the maximum death rate for each month from 2020 to 2021 in China ?
  (with additional visualisation in tableau/power bi can help better understand periodic patterns and trends for the death rate in China)

- In July 2021, what is the highest infection rate for each continent? Where is the location for that continent? What is the cumulative number of confirmed case for that location?

- Identify the cumulative number of deaths by July 2021 and list the deaths per population in descending order

- List the top 10 location with highest covid 19 death percentage

- Globally, what is the total number of cases and deaths between February 2020 and June 2021?
